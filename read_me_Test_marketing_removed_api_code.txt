This program, written in python3, uses open source openai api to generate 3 articles (in .docx format) daily and saves them in your document file.

My open ai api is redacted but you can enter your open ai api generated code--do not forget to put '' around code.
Remember, this requires payment to openai, and a functioning api code.

3 random articles are written on the topics of marketing, branding, and digital marketing.  The 3 articles are written in a 24 hour timeframe and repeated
until program is interrupted.

This is not to meant to replace article writers, merely assist in ideas.  It is always best to check the facts of the article and re-word this in your own 
writing style.
